    <h1>Paper cones and drag</h1>
    <p>by Zac Sayle - Year 12 Physics 2024</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Drag on objects is affected by several factors, namely the density of the fluid they are travelling through
        (<math>
            <mi>&rho;</mi>
        </math>), their relative velocity (<math>
            <mi>v</mi>
        </math>), and their cross-sectional area (<math>
            <mi>A</mi>
        </math>).</p>
    <p>These are related by the formulas</p>

    </math>
    <p>To determine how the size of a paper cone affected its drag, cones were made from circles of equal radii, but
        with different central angles for removed sectors. The time to fall a set distance was measured, which could
        then be used to calculate the average velocity, <math>
            <mi>v</mi>
        </math>, drag force, <math>
            <msub>
                <mi>F</mi>
                <mi>D</mi>
            </msub>
        </math>, and drag coefficient, <math>
            <msub>
                <mi>C</mi>
                <mi>D</mi>
            </msub>
        </math>. For the other variables not already stated, <math>
            <mi>p</mi>
        </math> is the absolute pressure of the air, <math>
            <msub>
                <mi>R</mi>
                <mi>specific</mi>
            </msub>
        </math> is the specific gas constant of air, and <math>
            <mi>T</mi>
        </math> is the absolute temperature of the air.</p>
    <p>While there have already been investigations into the most aerodynamic shapes for flight, this investigation
        could theoretically contribute to ensuring that those results remain valid for conical nose shapes.</p>
    <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
    <p>It is hypothesised that as the angle removed from the circle increases, fall time will decrease, because this
        change decreases the cross-sectional area, <math>
            <mi>A</mi>
        </math>. This also follows logical reasoning based on previous experience with letting things fall, especially
        considering the design of parachutes.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Paper (approx 73.8 g&middot;m<sup>-2</sup> was used)</li>
        <li>Scissors</li>
        <li>Sticky tape</li>
        <li>Protractor</li>
        <li>Compass &amp; pencil</li>
        <li>Scales</li>
        <li>Stopwatch &amp; video camera</li>
        <li>Ruler</li>
        <li>Thermometer</li>
        <li>Barometer</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Circles with equal radii were cut from similar pieces of paper</li>
        <li>A sector was cut from each circle, with the angle recorded. The remaining part of the circle was bent and
            taped into a conical shape. Six unique angles were used for this experiment, with the sector angles listed
            in the <a href="#results-combined">results</a>.</li>

        <li>A small (known) mass was placed into the first cone</li>
        <li>The first cone was dropped (tip-down) from the set 1.5&nbsp;m drop height (based on its tip's position).
            The
            time for the cone to touch the ground from release was measured with a stopwatch, and the drop was filmed
            with a video camera, providing an alternative method for finding the drop time. This was repeated for at
            least three trials with each cone</li>
        <li>Steps 3 & 4 were repeated with the remaining cones</li>
        <li>After all trials were completed, the videos were analysed in a video player, by counting the number of
            frames between the release of the cone and it first making contact with the ground, and then multiplying by
            the frame rate recorded in the metadata</li>

    <h3>Maintaining controlled variables</h3>
    <a href="#other-data">Jump to data collected about controlled variables</a>
    <p>In order to maintain the controlled variables, the following steps were taken:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Care was taken to drop the cones from a stationary position (so <math>
                <mi>u</mi>
                <mo>=</mo>
                <mn>0</mn>
            </math>, and <math>
                <msub>
                    <mi>F</mi>
                    <mi>&downarrow;</mi>
                </msub>
                <mo>=</mo>
                <mi>m</mi>
                <mo>&InvisibleTimes;</mo>
                <mi>g</mi>
            </math>)</li>
        <li>Each trial was conducted within the same room to ensure that the conditions of the air remained consistent,
            controlling <math>
                <mi>p</mi>
            </math>, <math>
                <msub>
                    <mi>R</mi>
                    <mi>specific</mi>
                </msub>
            </math>, <math>
                <mi>T</mi>
            </math>, and thus <math>
                <mi>&rho;</mi>
            </math></li>
        <li>An apparatus consisting of a ruler and a perpendicular object was set up to ensure that a consistent
            1.50&nbsp;m drop height was observed, ensuring <math>
                <mi>s</mi>
                <mo>=</mo>
                <mn>1.50</mn>

                <mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi>
            </math></li>
        <li>The gross mass of the cone was kept consistent as far as possible by using consistent paper, although the
            masses of each of the cones were measured in order to be able to account for these changes (because,
            naturally, given that different amounts of paper were used, this would vary slightly). Similarly, a
            consistent additional mass was used between all trials.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p><a href="media">All result videos can be accessed here</a>. They are organised by the angle of the remaining
        sector used to create the cone.</p>
    <p id="summary">Overall, there was some resemblance of a proportional relationship between the cross-sectional area
        of the cone and the the time which it took to fall to the ground, however this relationship became less obvious
        with larger areas.</p>

    <p>The data collected with the video camera is being treated as the main data used for analysis, as it is believed
        that it is more accurate, due to there being less room for introduced human error based on reaction times for
        stopping the stopwatch. The third trial for the 269&deg; cone should also be interpreted cautiously for two main
        reasons:

        <li>the mass in the cone fell out during the drop, a consequence of not properly following the original method,
            which would have included better securing it</li>
        <li>the results between the stopwatch measurement and the camera measurement differ significantly: for the
            stopwatch, the time is well below the mean, while for the camera, the time is well above the mean.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that this third trial for the 269&deg; cone was kept in the means for completeness. It is hoped that the
        additional trial undertaken for this cone will help to remove the error to some extent.</p>
    <p>Considering this, although the times from the video camera have been deemed more accurate, a "super mean" has
        been calculated by taking the means of both sets of results.</p>

        <figcaption>Plot of the mean time to fall vs. the angle cut to make the paper cone, including linear

    <p>Notably, in the data, the hypothesis is supported until the 269&deg; cone, as the average time to fall was longer
        than for the 226&deg; cone. This applies based on all three means.</p>
    <p>Other data was also collected for the purposes of allowing drag force and co-efficients to be calculated more
        effectively, based on the air conditions in the room which the experiment was conducted in. This is included,
        alongside any other data collected, for completeness and reproducibility purposes below.</p>

            <figcaption>Plot of the calculated drag co-efficient vs. the angle cut to make the paper cone.<br />The
                negative value is likely due to random experimental error, particularly in measurement.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </details>
    <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
    <p>Overall, particularly with the video results, there was a clear downward trend within the data. It is difficult
        to tell whether this fits a linear model based on the data collected, considering the significant gap in the
        data between 90&deg; and 180&deg;. If the experiment were to be run again, it would be worth collecting data for
        at least one point within this interval.</p>
    <h3>Errors</h3>
    <p>There were two significant errors which occurred during the running of the experiment, which were clearly visible
        in the data:</p>
    <h4>226&deg; cone negative drag</h4>
    <p>The drag co-efficient for the cone from the 226&deg; sector was negative, which should not be possible. This
        negative drag co-efficient is a result of the <a href="#drag-force-results">drag force being calculated as
            -0.000548&nbsp;N</a>. Practically, this result
        means that the measured acceleration was greater <span class="nowrap">than <math>
                <mi>g</mi>
            </math>, 9.8 m&middot;s<sup>-2</sup>,</span> and so the drag force had to work downwards to provide a great
        enough downward force to cause that level of acceleration. This does not follow expectations of drag, and points
        strongly towards error, especially considering that this was only observed for one cone, in one measurement system, and only three trials
        were undertaken, limiting the effectiveness of multiple repetitions for reducing random error.</p>
    <p>Given that the error was only found in the combined mean, significant measurement
        error while using the stopwatch is strongly suggested, owing greater authority to the video results, given their apparent greater
        accuracy.</p>
    <h4>269&deg; outlier</h4>
    <p>By both measurement systems, the 269&deg; cone presents itself as an outlier, with its drag coefficient being
        significantly higher than expected for such a pointy "streamlined" design. Again, it is likely that this was
        caused by some form of error in the dropping process or during the measurement, particularly considering that
        there were already <a href="#269-issues">potential problems</a> identified with this cone's drop process. Again,
        although an additional trial was conducted with the cone, it was insufficient at negating this error in
        the data. Aside from the already identified problems, this outlier could be caused by the cone rotating during
        the fall, and hence increasing its cross-sectional area during the fall. This possibility was not accounted for
        in the calculation of the drag co-efficient, as it was assumed to be consistent throughout the fall.</p>
    <p>Aside from running additional trials (the preferred remedy), it may be possible to remove the most problematic
        data point, however this may not be an ideal solution as the trial was technically performed correctly, and thus
        otherwise usable data would be discarded. This could be especially problematic with such a small dataset.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In line with assumptions and the hypothesis, the experiment makes it evident that pointier shapes experience less
        drag than flatter shapes. This knowledge may be useful in designing things which need to travel through fluids
        in some way, whether they demand more (e.g. parachutes) or less (e.g. planes) drag. Despite this, the additional
        instability introduced with more streamlined shapes (i.e. those with sharper noses) may outweigh the inherent
        reduced drag due to the rotation which could occur. Further research on this subject may be beneficial, however
        this suggests overall that there may be a limit to how much drag can be theoretically reduced for some
        applications without introducing excessive instability to the object.</p>
